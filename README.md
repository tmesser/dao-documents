Purpose 
--------

Most DAOs, at the time of this writing, are not fully understood by many
existing legal frameworks. This repository is for the development of documents
that suit a DAO’s specific needs, while complying with existing regulations as
well as is practicable. In order to provide some level of consensus and
durability to the documents in the documents in this repository, legal opinions
of document review will be uploaded as they are made available. **Under no
circumstances should anything in this repository be taken as legal advice.** It
is the responsibility of whomever uses these documents to fully understand and
take ownership of the agreements they forge using these documents. **This
repository is intended as a resource for the public good and all documents and
documentation are provided ‘as-is’.**
