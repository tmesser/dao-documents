                other form, or whether such information was or is tangible or
                intangible or obtained from observation; and

            9.  any copies of the foregoing. Confidential Information shall

                “Confidential Information.” If the information disclosed was or
                is oral, then it shall be presumed by Contractor to be
                Confidential Information. In addition, Contractor acknowledges
                that by the very nature of the Services they perform for
                Collective, they may become aware of Collective’s Confidential
                Information. Contractor agrees that all such information shall
                be used by Contractor only to perform the Services, and for no
                other purpose.

        2.  Each party agrees to receive and maintain all Confidential
            Information in strictest confidence using, at a minimum, reasonable
            care and, except as provided herein, shall not use Confidential
            Information for its own benefit or disclose it to third parties
            without the prior written consent of the other party.

        3.  The obligations of the parties under this paragraph shall survive
            the expiration or termination of this Agreement and shall be binding
            on the parties, their successors and assigns.

        4.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither party shall have any
            obligations under this Agreement with respect to information which

            1.  is publicly available at the time of disclosure;

            2.  is disclosed to the receiving party by a third party, unless the
                receiving party is aware that the third party is subject to an
                obligation of confidentiality with respect to such information;

            3.  becomes publicly available after disclosure through no act of
                the receiving party; or

            4.  is independently developed by the receiving party without breach
                of this Agreement.

        5.  Notwithstanding the foregoing restrictions Collective or Contractor
            may use and disclose any information

            1.  to the extent required by an order of any court or other
                governmental authority, or

            2.  as necessary for it or them to protect their interest in this
                Agreement, but in each case only after each party has been so
                notified and has had the opportunity to obtain reasonable
                protection for such information in connection with such
                disclosure.

            solely or jointly with any other, which are made with the use of
            Collective’s equipment, supplies, facilities, trade secrets, or
            time, or which relate to the business of Collective or Collective’s
            actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development, or which
            result, either in whole or in part, from any work performed for
            Collective, such Invention shall belong to Collective, and
            Contractor agrees to assign any and all rights, title and interest
            in such Invention to Collective. For purposes of this Agreement, an

        6.  Contractor agrees to make full disclosure to Collective of all
            ideas, designs, concepts, writings, discoveries, inventions,

            this Agreement, and shall do everything necessary or desirable to
            vest the absolute title thereto in Collective. To the extent that
            Contractor may be entitled to claim any ownership interest in any

            Collective all of her right, title and interest in and to such
            rights and materials, under all applicable patent, copyright, trade
            secret and trademark laws, in perpetuity or for the longest period
            otherwise permitted by law. Contractor further agrees to furnish
            promptly to Collective complete information thereon and execute all
            documents (including assignment in a form specified by Collective),
            furnish all information, and do all things necessary to facilitate
            the consideration of, and the filing and prosecution of,

            compensation from, but at the expense of, Collective.

        7.  Contractor agrees that they are not entitled to any additional or
            special compensation or reimbursement regarding any ideas, designs,
            concepts, writings, discoveries, inventions, improvements,
            processes, procedures, techniques, or developments that are deemed
            to be the property of Collective by the terms of this Agreement.

            cooperate with Collective to assign any and all Intellectual
            Property Rights to Collective under this Agreement. In the event
            that the jurisdiction of Contract may not permit the transfer of
            intellectual property rights to Collective, then Contractor shall
            provide Collective with an exclusive license to any and all
            Intellectual Property used in connection with or otherwise developed
            under this Agreement to Collective, with no limitations.

    7.  *Indemnification.* Contractor agrees to indemnify, defend and hold
        Collective harmless from and against any liability arising out of or in
        connection with

        1.  the negligent or willful acts of Contractor in the performance of
            her obligations hereunder, or

        2.  the breach by Contractor of any of her obligations hereunder.

    8.  *Data Protection.* Contractor shall comply with the privacy and data
        protection terms contained in the Data Processing Addendum, attached
        hereto and incorporated herein as **Exhibit C** (“**DPA**”), when
        processing proprietary, confidential, or other protected information,
        including, but not limited to, Personal Information (as defined in the

            consistent with the standards of competent service providers
            performing comparable services in the same or similar locality.
            Contractor warrants that they shall not knowingly provide Services
            that violate or infringe upon any third party’s intellectual
            property rights. If Contractor becomes aware of any such possible
            infringement in the course of performing the Services under this
            Agreement, Contractor shall immediately notify Collective in
            writing.

        3.  Each party represents to the other party that it has the power and
            authority to enter into this Agreement and that it is not a party to
            any restrictions, agreements or understandings whatsoever which
            would prevent or make unlawful such party’s acceptance of the terms
            set forth in this Agreement or such party’s performance hereunder.
            Each party further represents that its acceptance of the terms of
            this Agreement and the performance of its obligations hereunder do
            not and will not (with the passage of time) conflict with or
            constitute a breach or default of any contract, agreement or
            understanding, oral or written, to which such party is a party or by
            which such party is bound.

    10. *Taxes.*

        1.  All amounts required to be paid by Collective to Contractor under
            this Agreement are exclusive of any and all duties and taxes,

            personal property, retail sales, goods and services, use or value
            added taxes and whether such taxes are now in force or subsequently
            levied. Contractor shall pay and be responsible for all such taxes
            in the event of a levy or lien due to non-payment of taxes. The
            failure to pay taxes in accordance with law resulting in penalties,
            liens, or levies, shall constitute a breach of this Agreement.

        2.  Collective shall not be responsible for any federal, state, local or
            foreign tax on, or measured by, the net income of Contractor, or any
            fines, penalties, or interest imposed as a result of the misconduct
            or negligence of Contractor.

        date hereof and continuing for a period of \_______\_ following the

            developed for Collective, to the Collective immediately. Once such
            transfer is confirmed in writing by Collective, then Contractor
            shall destroy any data related to any deliverables under this
            Agreement, whether in digital or hard copy.

    13. **LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.** IN NO EVENT SHALL COLLECTIVE BE LIABLE FOR
        ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND
        IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, EVEN IF INFORMED IN ADVANCE OF THE
        POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.”

    14. *Governing Law; Jurisdiction.* This Agreement shall be governed and
        construed by the laws of \________________________. Each party hereby
        irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the relevant courts
        for the purposes of any proceedings arising out of this Agreement.

    15. *Entire Agreement.* This Agreement (including its exhibits) constitutes
        the entire agreement of the parties pertaining to the subject matter
        hereof and merges all prior negotiations and drafts of the parties with
        regard to the transactions contemplated herein. Any and all other
        written or oral agreements existing between the parties hereto regarding
        such transactions are expressly canceled. In the event of any conflict
        between this Agreement and any of the exhibits attached hereto, the
        terms of this Agreement shall govern.

    16. *Amendment.* This Agreement shall not be modified or amended except by a
        further written document signed by the parties.

    17. *Waiver.* No provisions hereof may be waived except by an agreement in
        writing signed by the parties. A waiver of any term or provision hereof

        hereof.

    18. *Binding Effect.* This Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of
        the parties hereto and their respective successors, heirs and permitted
        assigns.

    19. *Assignment.* This Agreement is a personal service contract and may not
        be assigned by either party without the prior written consent of the
        other party; provided, however, that Collective may assign this
        Agreement without Contractor’s consent in connection with the sale of
        all or substantially all of Collective’s capital stock or assets.

    20. *Notice.* Any notice required or permitted to be given under this
        Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been

        or by facsimile transmission with confirmation, to such party at its
        address set forth below:

|                   |   | Facsimile: \_______________________________\_ |

    21. *Disputes.* Any disagreement between the Parties regarding, related to,
        or arising from this Agreement (including any disagreement regarding (i)
        any act or omission by a Party, or (ii) the interpretation or
        enforceability of any provision of this Agreement) (a “**Dispute**”)
        will be determined by arbitration in \___________\_ (an
        “**Arbitration**”), which will be administered by \__________\_ (or its
        successor organization, an **“Arbitration Administrator”**) pursuant to
        its Arbitration Rules and Procedures. The language used in any
        Arbitration will be English. An Arbitration will be presided over by one
        arbitrator (the “**Arbitrator**”) who will be mutually agreed to by the
        Parties. If the Parties are unable to agree upon an Arbitrator within
        thirty (30) days of the commencement of the Arbitration, then the
        Arbitrator will be determined in accordance with the applicable rules
        and procedures of the Arbitration Administrator. The Arbitrator will
        apply the laws relating to the jurisdiction set forth in *(14)*.
        Judgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.
        This Section will not preclude the Parties from seeking provisional
        remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.
        The Parties further understand and agree that the decision of the
        Arbitrator will be final and binding to the fullest extent permitted by
        law and enforceable by any court having jurisdiction thereof. The
        Parties will maintain the confidential nature of any Arbitration
        proceeding and the award, if any, including the privacy of the hearing,
        except as may be necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration
        hearing on the merits, or except as may be necessary in connection with
        a court application for a preliminary remedy, a judicial challenge to an
        award or its enforcement, or unless otherwise required by law or
        judicial decision. The prevailing party in any Dispute will be entitled
        to be reimbursed for all reasonable costs incurred by such party in such
        Dispute by the non-prevailing party, including its reasonable attorneys’
        fees. The remedies available to the Parties pursuant to this Section
        will be the sole exclusive remedies available to the Parties with
        respect to any Dispute. Prior to the appointment of the arbitrator or
        for remedies beyond the jurisdiction of an arbitrator, at any time,
        either Party may seek temporary or preliminary relief in accordance with
        this Section, pendente lite, without thereby waiving its right to
        arbitration of the dispute or controversy herein. In the event that the
        jurisdiction of Contractor wholly precludes any dispute from being
        addressed under this Section, then any claims or disputes shall be
        governed by the rules of the International Chamber of Commerce then
        prevailing (the “ICC Rules”), wherein the Parties agree that the
        arbitration shall be conducted by an arbitral tribunal consisting of a
        sole arbitrator, in English, in the jurisdiction set forth in *(14)*.
        Furthermore, if the parties cannot agree on a sole arbitrator within
        thirty (30) days, the appointment of the arbitrator shall be made in
        accordance with ICC Rules.

    22. *Counterparts; Electronic Signatures.* This Agreement may be executed in
        multiple counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original, but all
        of which together will constitute one and the same instrument.
        Counterparts may be delivered via facsimile, electronic mail (including
        pdf or any electronic signature complying with the relevant governing
        law, e.g., www.docusign.com), or other transmission method and any
        counterpart so delivered will be deemed to have been duly and validly
        delivered and be valid and effective for all purposes.

    23. *Electronic Delivery.* This Agreement to the extent signed and delivered
        by means of a facsimile machine or electronic transmission in portable
        document format, will be treated in all manner and respects as an
        original agreement or instrument and will be considered to have the same
        binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version delivered
        in person. No Party to this Agreement may raise the use of a facsimile
        machine or electronic transmission in portable document format to
        deliver a signature or the fact that any signature or agreement or
        instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of a
        facsimile machine or electronic transmission in portable document format
        as a defense to the formation or enforceability of a contract and each
        such Party forever waives any such defense.

    24. *Severability.* The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of
        this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
        remaining provisions (including any remaining provisions within the same
        numbered paragraph), unless the absence of such invalid or unenforceable
        provision materially and adversely affects the right or obligations of
        either party hereto.

    25. *Survival.* In the event of any termination of this Agreement, Sections
        4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22,
        23, and 24, hereof shall survive and continue in effect and shall inure
        to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties and their legal
        representatives, heirs, successors, and assigns.

        generation, storage, and otherwise processing of the Personal
        Information.

    2.  *Treatment of Personal Information*. Supplier acknowledges that during
        the performance of its Agreement with Collective, Supplier may have

            event Supplier does not take into consideration Collective’s
            objections), or

        2.  as required by law or a government authority (in which case Supplier
            shall use its best efforts to notify Collective before such
            disclosure or as soon thereafter as reasonably possible). Supplier
            shall remain fully liable for all acts or omissions of its
            subcontractors. Supplier will upon the instruction of Collective:
            access, correct, delete or block any Personal Information, and
            otherwise reasonably support Collective to fulfill its obligations
            to respond to requests from individuals to exercise their rights (or
            provide Collective or Collective’s users the ability to access,
            correct, delete or block Personal Information and exercise other
            applicable rights); provide all reasonable assistance to Collective
            as may be reasonably requested in performing, where required, a data
            protection impact assessment and in consulting with competent
            authorities; and immediately inform Collective if Supplier is of the
            opinion that an instruction of Collective regarding processing
            Personal Information infringes applicable data privacy laws

    3.  *Data Related Requests*. If Supplier receives from a governmental agency
        or an individual an access request, a deletion request, a rectification
        request, an investigative notice, a seizure, or a complaint related to
        Collective’s Confidential Information, Supplier will immediately notify
        Collective (within 24 hours) unless such notification is prohibited by
        applicable law. Supplier shall not be responsible for directly
        responding to any Data Subject Access Requests (DSAR) originating from
        Collective data subjects.

    4.  *Data Retention.* Supplier shall retain Personal Information only for as
        long as necessary to provide Services to Collective. Upon request by
        Collective at any time or upon termination of the parties agreement for
        any reason, Supplier shall promptly return to Collective, in the formats
        and on the media in or on which such data exists, all or any part of the
        Personal Information and Collective Confidential Information in
        Supplier’s possession or at Collective’s request shall, erase, delete,
        or destroy all or any part of such information. An executive officer of
        Supplier shall certify in writing to Collective that all such
        information has been erased and/or destroyed.

    5.  *International Data.* If Supplier will be processing Personal
        Information outside, or originating from outside, of the United States,
        Supplier shall promptly execute, and shall cause its affiliate(s) and
        subcontractor(s) processing such information to execute, supplemental
        privacy and security terms with Collective and/or its affiliates,
        including but not limited to the Standard Contractual Clauses for the
        Transfer of Personal Data to Processors Established in Third Countries,

        Model Contract”), as are required in Collective’s sole judgment to
        process and/or transfer Personal Information in accordance with
        applicable law. To the extent required by law, such terms shall be
        governed by the law of the applicable jurisdiction. If Supplier
        currently has alternative transfer methods that have been certified by
        the relevant data protection authorities, such as Binding Corporate
        Rules or APEC Cross Border Privacy Rules, Supplier will provide
        Collective with sixty (60) days written notice prior to any date on
        which certification for Supplier’s transfer method ends.

3.  **Data Security Requirements**

    1.  *Information Security Standard.* Supplier agrees that it will use its
        best efforts to maintain administrative, technical, and physical
        safeguards that are no less rigorous than industry best practices to
        ensure the security and confidentiality of Personal Information and
        Collective Confidential Information, protect against any anticipated
        threats or hazards to the confidentiality, availability or integrity of
        Personal Information and Collective Confidential Information, and
        protect against unauthorized access, use, or alteration of Personal
        Information and Collective Confidential Information.

4.  **Data Security Incidents**

    1.  *Data Incident Procedures.* Supplier shall immediately communicate
        (within 24 hours) any Incident to Collective by sending an email with
        all available and relevant details to the Collective using official
        Notice procedures. In addition, Supplier shall do the following:

        1.  In the event of an Incident, Supplier shall immediately coordinate
            with Collective regarding the response to, and investigation of, the
            Incident, and cooperate fully with Collective, including
            facilitating interviews with contractors or employees and other
            parties, making available all relevant records, logs, files, data
            reporting and other materials, and providing Collective with
            physical access to the facilities affected.

        2.  Unless required by law, Supplier shall not inform any third party of
            any Incident without first obtaining Collective’s prior written
            consent, other than to inform a complainant that the matter has been
            forwarded to Collective’s legal counsel.

        3.  Following an Incident , whether or not it relates to Collective
            Confidential Information, Supplier shall document responsive actions
            taken in connection with the Incident and shall conduct a
            post-breach review of events and actions taken, if any, to make
            changes in security practices and procedures to prevent such
            Incident from occurring again in the future.

    2.  *Incident Remediation.* Supplier shall use its best efforts to
        immediately mitigate and remedy any Incident and prevent any further
        Incident at its sole expense.

    3.  *Third Party notification.* Supplier agrees that Collective shall have
        the sole right to determine

        1.  whether notice of an Incident involving Collective Personal
            Information is to be provided to any individuals, regulators, law
            enforcement agencies, consumer reporting agencies or others as
            required by law or regulation, or otherwise in Collective’s
            discretion,

        2.  the contents of such notice, and

        3.  whether any type of remediation may be offered to affected persons,
            as well as the nature and extent of any such remediation. In the
            event of an Incident involving Personal Information in Supplier’s
            possession or otherwise caused by or related to Supplier’s acts or
            omissions, and without limiting Collective’s other rights and
            remedies, Supplier will pay all reasonable costs and expenses of

            1.  any disclosures and notification required by applicable law or
                as otherwise determined as appropriate in Collective’s
                reasonable discretion,

            2.  monitoring and reporting on the impacted individuals’ or
                entities’ credit records if determined in Collective’s
                reasonable discretion as reasonable to protect such individuals,
                and

            3.  all other costs incurred by Collective in responding to,
                remediating and mitigating damages caused by such Incident.

5.  **General Provisions**

    1.  *Restrictions to Collective Systems and Collective Confidential
        Information.* Upon a Supplier’s failure to comply with any of the
        provisions contained in this Addendum, in addition to such other
        remedies that may be available to Collective, Collective may restrict
        offending Supplier personnel from accessing Collective Systems and
        Collective Confidential Information.
